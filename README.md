# thousand_dice_simulator
Simulates 1000s of dice rolls and outputs statistical analysis in seconds.

Records each randomly generated number into a CSV file; the statistical analysis and simulation speed is provided at the end of the file. 

How to Use: NOTE: Future versions, if there are any, will focus on ease-of-use.

Make sure you have python installed on your mac or PC: Google "how tell if python installed on PC." Most Macs and Linux OSes will have it installed already.
Download thousand_dice_simulator.py.
Run weigh_me_main.py. To do this, do the following: Window/PC: Open the command prompt. In most cases, you should be able to type in "cd downloads", going straight to the "downloads" working directory. From here, type: "py thousand_dice_simulator.py." You should find the newly generated CSV file in the same folder as the .py file. 
Instructions for Mac and Linux OS TBA (but are quite simular). 
Alternatively, if you have a programming IDE installed, like PyCharm or VisualStudio, you can easily run the code in them.
